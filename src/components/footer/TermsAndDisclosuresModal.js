            <p>22. ADVERTISING DISCLOSURES</p>
            <p>
              Typical bill savings estimates are based on 20-year savings with a
              5kW solar system. These estimates assume a utility inflation rate
              of 2.2% and assume 84% percent of needs met by solar panels. The
              electricity rates used are state averages as of September of 2016
              (according to EIA). Ownership of the solar system and panels is
              also assumed. Typical savings may vary according to roof, shading,
              and other home properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              A consumers eligibility to have the costs of their solar
              installation covered in their state will depend on their tax
              liability. The Federal ITC is a 30 percent tax credit (as of 2019)
              on residential (under Section 25D) and commercial (under Section
              48) properties that is available in states across America (see
              https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc).
              The average cost of installing solar in terms of labor is around
              10% of system costs* and can vary by state, project scope, and
              installation company. In most cases, a consumer will have more
              than enough credit to cover the cost of their solar installation
              provided they have enough tax liability to take advantage of the
              ITC.
            </p>
            <p>
              *A typical or average size of a solar system is about 5kW (about
              15-25 panels) and typically costs around $30,000. This amount can
              vary tremendously by state and the project scope. The Lawrence
              Berkley National Laboratory (LBNL) estimates that the average cost
              of labor for a solar projevt is around $0.59/W, which is generally
              around 10% of the total cost to install a solar system (assuming a
              solar system and installation cost of $6.19/W). This means that
              the average cost to install a typical sized solar system should be
              around $3,000. These estimates are subject to change as
              technological breakthroughs are constantly bringing the cost of
              solar lower and lower.
            </p>
            <p>
              A consumers eligibility to get paid to install solar will also
              depend on rebates and incentives available in their state, their
              utility company, and tax liability. Eligible users can receive
              payments in the form of $/watt of solar installed (depending on
              their utility provider), in the form of a monetary payment for
              projects that are within a certain scope (i.e., Maryland will pay
              you $1,000 it you install a solar system smaller than 20 kW at
              your primary residence and use a solar installer with a NABCEP
              certification), in the form of monetary compensation, or
              otherwise, from utility providers that offer net metering
              programs, or in the form of a credit on your income taxes
              (provided you have enough tax liability to take advantage). All
              payments are subject to terms, eligibility, and availability and
              can change over time.
